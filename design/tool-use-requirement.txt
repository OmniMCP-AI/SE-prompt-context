Tool typical requirement from tool chaining , so that it could improve success rate.

Tools might encounter tool size too large , need generate concrete tool and  preview tool .(exceed LLM token limit)
Tools call might fail, need to switch alternative tool by searching for similar tool.
 - one function got error for  4xx error , 500 error either require api key , 429 error /etc , then switch another alternative
Tools might also need some pre post operation ,such as :
 - case sensitive funcation parameter, need to lowercase the funcation parameter,  
 - for more friendly converter (crypto token address convert to token symbol)

my solution proposal:
steps:
- user's input with task_id as context, user's question
- agent call tool1, save agent call result1 to db during MCP tool call stage(in Omnimcp-be)
- agent call tool2, save agent call result2 to db during MCP tool call stage(in Omnimcp-be)
- agent use tool3 with pandas.ai use tool to query context to gather back the context to generate code using LLM.(which is with new tool)
  - typical glue code , given user's requirentment , tool call result1 , result2.
    - such as convert address to token    
  - with the code execution return as tool call result 
- continue the agent run execution

my solution proposal:
steps:

- prepare stage:
  - user's input with task_id as context, user's question
  - inject a new convet_tool for the convert since we already known tool1 output address, probably need to convert address to symbol tool

- agent call tool1, save agent call result1 to db during MCP tool call stage(in Omnimcp-be)
- agent call convert_tool for the convertion 
  -- it will call search_best_tool according to user's input, and tool1 result schema 
  -- hopefully it will select the convert_tool  via search_best_tool
  -- call the search_best_tool result via function call 
- do the result of the agent run or rest of function call
