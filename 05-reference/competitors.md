# Comparison with UniQ

**UniQ** offers a more mature platform for Web3 analytics, with key differences:

- **Tool Reliability:** 
  - UniQ’s tools are more stable, with consistent input/output handling. OmniMCP struggles with tool failures (e.g., API downtime, schema errors).

- **Agent Stability:** 
  - UniQ’s agents execute tasks reliably with predictable tool calls. OmniMCP’s agents face inconsistent tool selection and execution failures.

- **Use Case Coverage:** 
  - UniQ effectively covers crypto analytics. OmniMCP progresses but faces gaps in dashboard integration (e.g., Dune’s SQL limitations) and tool availability.

- **Automation:** 
  - UniQ likely has a more automated tool testing and agent creation pipeline. OmniMCP’s tool knowledge generation is slow and requires manual intervention.
