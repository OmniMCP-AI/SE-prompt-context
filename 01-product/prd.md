# Intelligent Workflow Planning Platform PRD (July 2025)

## 1. Product Overview

### 1.1 Product Positioning
An intelligent platform that automatically generates and executes workflows through natural language conversations. Users simply describe their needs in natural language, and the system understands intent, formulates plans, executes automatically, and delivers results.

### 1.2 Core Value
- **User Value:** Get professional automation solutions by speaking naturally, without learning any tools.
- **Differentiation:** Upgrade from "tool-using" to "business-process-understanding" AI advisor.
- **Business Value:** Enable ordinary business users to enjoy efficiency improvements from automation.

## 2. System Architecture Design

### 2.1 Four-Layer Core Architecture

#### 2.1.1 Intent Recognition Layer
**Primary Responsibility:** Understanding what users really want.

When a user says, "Help me search for the latest AI news and organize it into a weekly report," this layer needs to understand:
- This is an information collection and organization requirement.
- The user is focused on the latest developments in the AI field.
- The final output should be a structured weekly report format.
- It may need regular execution (characteristic of weekly reports).

**Core problems this layer solves:**
- Identify user's business scenario type (data analysis, information collection, content generation, etc.).
- Extract key parameters (time range, data sources, output format).
- Understand implicit requirements (report quality, delivery method, update frequency).

#### 2.1.2 Planning Layer
**Primary Responsibility:** Formulate optimal execution plans.

Based on identified intent, this layer must answer:
- How many steps should this requirement be broken down into?
- Which tools are most suitable for each step?
- Are there available tools that support completing the current step?
- What are the dependencies between steps?
- How long is it estimated to take? What's the success rate?
- What's the current configuration status of tools?

**Core capabilities of the planning layer:**
- Best practices knowledge based on real workflow data.
- Ability to predict common problems and solutions.
- Optimize plans based on user historical preferences.
- Balance execution efficiency and result quality.

#### 2.1.3 Master Agent Layer
**Primary Responsibility:** Orchestrate execution and quality control.

This layer is the "project manager" of the entire execution process, responsible for:
- Deciding which tasks to handle themselves and which to delegate to specialized agents.
- Monitoring execution progress and quality of each task.
- Handling exceptions during execution.
- Ensuring final results meet user expectations.

**Key decision logic:**
- Task complexity assessment: handle simple tasks themselves, find experts for complex tasks.
- Parallel execution optimization: identify tasks that can run simultaneously.
- Quality control: check intermediate results, re-execute when necessary.
- Exception recovery: automatically find alternative solutions when certain steps fail.

#### 2.1.4 Dynamic Tool Layer
**Primary Responsibility:** Provide flexible tool invocation capabilities.

This layer manages all available tools and services:
- Real-time discovery and registration of new tools.
- Match the most suitable tools based on task requirements.
- Handle tool invocation details (parameter formats, authentication, retries, etc.).
- Automatically switch to backup solutions when tools fail.

**Tool management strategies:**
- Support standard MCP protocol for easy third-party tool integration.
- Dynamic loading, add new tools without system restart.
- Intelligent failover, automatically use backup tools when primary tools are unavailable.
- Performance monitoring, continuously optimize tool selection strategies.

### 2.3 Unified Authorization Management Layer
