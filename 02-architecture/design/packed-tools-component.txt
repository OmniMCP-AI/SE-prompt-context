 omnimcp.ai has a brunch of tools with categories tags likes: 
 DeFi & Trading, Cryptocurrency, Blockchain, Memecoins, Social & Sentiment, NFT & GameFi, Search, Data Tools, Media & Content, Communication, Wallet, Financial, 
 but when use in realword cases such as using it for manage 1k CV in HR system for 
  storage and find suitable candidate or query candidate either by NL or by filter with UI 
  this scenario seems a bit complex for non technical user or those who are not familar with system

i need to design tool usage for best practise for building agents swarm  or app for this scenario.
my propose for the pipeline:
- write to system 
    - single files once upload will  :
        - store is OSS as rawfile 
        - parse to text  return as oss link 
        - store to DB(MongoDB/SQL database) as parsed text         
        - meanwhile this file will persist to VectorDB like qdrant 
    by default process this pipeline , but i'm not sure about this :
       when and what will save to nosql/sql/vector, 
       according to different files type /file context seems might be different answers.
       such as for stureture data , probably need sql like db, but this also affect the read from system stages

    
- read from system
    - according to user nature lanuage or interatc with UI passed filter to system 
      then query DB using RAG from VectorDB and query from DB(nosql or sql) 
        to retrivele single or multiple file from system     
        this case need use get_private_knowledge tools 
- when run trigger schedule
    -  fetch muliple file form system 
        run a for loop (unimplemented) to run agent workflow 

     
- how to build a packed tools(when upload file , usually need ) for this scenario
