# Context-Aware System Design

## 1. System Overview

A context-aware system that manages and distributes context for AI agents and system components, implementing **context engineering** principles to fill context windows with just the right information at each step. The system addresses context failures through strategic context management techniques.

### 1.1 Context Engineering Principles

Context engineering is the art and science of filling the context window with just the right information at each step of an agent's trajectory. This involves four core strategies:

- **Writing Context**: Saving information outside the context window (scratchpads, memories)
- **Selecting Context**: Pulling relevant information into the context window (RAG, tool selection)
- **Compressing Context**: Retaining only required tokens (summarization, pruning)
- **Isolating Context**: Splitting context across separate threads (multi-agent, quarantine)

### 1.2 Context Failure Mitigation

The system addresses common context failures:

- **Context Poisoning**: Hallucinations propagating through context
- **Context Distraction**: Over-focus on context at expense of training knowledge
- **Context Confusion**: Superfluous information degrading responses
- **Context Clash**: Conflicting information within context
